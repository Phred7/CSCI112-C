Chapter 10 - CSCI112

Section 10.1
  Show student.h

 Show struct1.c with declaring variables of type student_t

 Show struct2.c to show the . operator using printing
   run struct2

 Discuss examples of structures: names and phone numbers
 
 practice: create a structure for lat and lon for Museum of the rockies and print value

 Show struct3.c to show how to set one structure to another and then we have to figure out how to deal with the string name (we will have to use strcpy)

 show struct4.c to show how to deal with name, go over all the changes needed

 show struct5.c to show how to work with an array of structures

 show struct6.c to show how to work with arrays within an array of structures

 show struct7.c to show how to pass a structure as input

Section 10.2
 show struct8.c showing how to compare two structures

 show struct9.c to show how to read in a structure and how to dealw tih a pointer to a structure

 show struct10.c to show that using (*studnt).name is the same as studnt->name

 practice: read in information for our location structure and print the structure out

Section 10.3
 show struct11.c to show how to return a data structure

 show struct12.c and how the input and output work

 practice: create a structure for a fraction: numerator, denominator and real value
    write a function for passing in as structure and passing back the fraction in the simplest 
    terms. show prac3.c first (recursion) then prac4.c
